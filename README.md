## Rules

* Each tool shall be self-sufficient, so that people will have the least trouble when copy-pasting them for their own research or other things
* Each tool shall have tests
  * automated testing of these tools are not practical and therefore not done
  * The test shall create an A/B which should sound the same if tool behaves properly.
